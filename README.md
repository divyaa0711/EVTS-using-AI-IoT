# EVTS-using-AI-IoT

An Emergency Vehicle Transit System uses AI and IoT to optimize traffic flow and provide priority to emergency vehicles like ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars. It involves real-time vehicle tracking, smart traffic signal control, and predictive analytics to minimize delays.

Key Components:
1).  IoT-Based Emergency Vehicle Tracking
2). AI-Powered Traffic Management
3). Cloud & Data Processing

Working:
Step 1: Emergency Vehicle Detection
        Vehicle GPS and IoT sensors send real-time location to the cloud.
        Cameras at traffic signals use AI-based computer vision to recognize emergency vehicles.
Step 2: Traffic Light Control Using AI
        If an emergency vehicle is detected within a certain range, the system adjusts traffic lights to allow a clear path.
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to optimize traffic light changes dynamically.
Step 3: Route Optimization
        AI-based shortest path algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, A)* analyze traffic congestion.
        The system suggests the best route to the emergency vehicle driver via the mobile app.
Step 4: Real-Time Communication with Other Vehicles
        IoT-enabled smart road signs and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication alert nearby vehicles to move aside.
Step 5: Data Analysis & Continuous Improvement
        Big Data & AI analyze historical traffic patterns to improve system performance.
